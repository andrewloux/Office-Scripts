Office Scripts
==============

**Helping you automate your desktop experience. An opensource experiment powered by Python.**

Office Scripts is a place to conglomerate all those scripts you have automating your work and/or desktop life. To start this off, we have several scripts
that my colleague and I have worked on that we use, and we're waiting for you on the [community page](http://www.reddit.com/r/OfficeScripts) to request or 
contribute your own!

This repository is a dump for all the scripts connected to the Office Scripts project, however, each script is stored in its own repository with its corresponding
documentation. Follow the Script List below to see what we`ve been working on.

### Get Started

To explore our existing collection of scripts that may come in handy, check out Script List section right below. To fork the entire collection of scripts, clone this repo, or hit any of the download links at the top of this page.
```
$ git clone https://github.com/alouis93/Office-Scripts
```

***Contributing***
To contribute, simply email one of the admin to request access to the git.

You'll find a lot of scripts around here with very specific use-cases, and while this is supported, we strongly recommend to make your scripts work for as 
general a range of input as is reasonable. 

To keep it simple, and because **Python** is a new-programmer favourite, Office Scripts will only support Python scripts for the time being.


***Need Help?***
The [Office Scripts subreddit](http://www.reddit.com/OfficeScripts) will be our hub, so find us over there, and we can discuss implementation.

We strongly encourage you to attempt to code a solution to your problem, and then contribute it to the home repository before seeking out the community for
help on your script.
